excerpt: "Integrated Circuit Resilience & Security"

We believe that cybersecurity and information assurance begins with hardware security. At a fundamental level, information must be processed on physical devices and transferred through physical channels.  We work at the intersection of materials science, device physics, circuit design, and systems analysis, to understand and secure these physical devices and channels.


We are a research group affiliated with the [**Center for National Security Initiatives**](https://www.colorado.edu/center/nsi/) and the [**Department of Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering**](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/) at the [**University of Colorado Boulder**](https://www.colorado.edu).
