Microelectronics are a ubiquitous presence in our society, and assuring their 
safe and continuing operation is paramount for sustaining our modern way of 
life. Hardware failures, whether caused by resilience or security issues, have
caused stock market glitches, self-driving car accidents, massive denial of 
online services, and the loss of critical and private information.

Our research addresses the issues of Integrated Circuit Resilience and Security 
(ICRS\*), by leveraging experience and expertise across the entire 
microelectronics life cycle. This life cycle is increasingly multidisciplinary 
and complex, and includes electronic materials, device physics, circuit design, 
fabrication, packaging, metrology, and failure analysis.

(\*Stylized as "icaris" and pronounced /ˈɪkərəs/ like the mythological Greek
character.) 

We are a research group affiliated with the [**Center for National Security 
Initiatives**](https://www.colorado.edu/center/nsi/) and the [**Department of 
Electrical, Computer & Energy Engineering**](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/) 
at the [**University of Colorado Boulder**](https://www.colorado.edu).
